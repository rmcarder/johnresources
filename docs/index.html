<h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>First, thank you for providing feedback on the survey. Your input is valuable as we work to become a better funder. Recognizing that our grantee partners are very diverse and no set of resources could possibly be applicable to all, the resources on this site are aimed at an introductory level; the kinds of things that might be useful to an organization just starting to think about a given topic. Some of you have been thinking about these topics for a long time, are the true experts, and therefore may not find anything new. Wherever you are on a given topic, please dont hesitate to reach out to your program officer if you would like to have a more in depth conversation around how we may be able to provide additional support.</p>
                <p>The results of the first survey question are below. As each topic received at least a third of respondents rating additional resources as 'very useful,' we have included resources on all topics. Navigate to each of them using the menu on the right.</p>
                
                
             
 

<!-- TODO  these should navigate --></section><section id="section-02" class="section tabcontent"><a id="anchor-02" class="anchor"></a><h1>Communications to Advance Your Work</h1>
            <p>We realize strategic communications may look quite different in different contexts. Therefore, the resources provivded here aim to cover basic universal concepts, with more specific applicability noted where that is the case.</p>

          <h2> Additional Support and Resources WPF Can Provide</h2>
          <p>Wellspring has a working group focused on supporting grantees internationally (especially in East Africa and to some extent in Latin America) to research, test, and/or evaluate communications that target specific audiences and seek to change knowledge, attitudes, and/or behaviours related to particular social justice issues. The working group has created a newsletter of free resources and references that might be of interest (an example of the newsletter can be seen <a href="/assets/resources/CommsNewsletter.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>). Please contact your program officer if you would like to be put in touch with the working group and/or be added to the list that receives the newsletter.</p>

<p>Wellspring is committed to supporting organizations to be as secure as they can be (and striving to being as secure as possible ourselves). We take a holistic view of security, encompassing physical, travel, and digital security, as well as overall well-being. The list of resources below contains two short checklists developed by Wellspring staff and a security consultant, plus an online assessment that provides personalized online security recommendations.</p>

                <h2>Additional Support WPF Can Offer</h2>
              
                <p>Wellspring works closely with a security advisor, who is available to provide confidential and no-cost security guidance via phone, email, or Skype. We are happy to send an email introduction. </p>
                <p>In addition, there are a number of organizations we work with that provide emergency/rapid response grants, support for human rights defenders at risk, grants and training to organizations looking to strengthen their digital security, and support to organizations that believe they may have been hacked. Please contact your program officer if any of these could be useful to your organization.</p>
